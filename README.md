# Steps Calculator

Set a goal for the month and use this at any time to calculate how many steps you need to take each day to reach your goal by the end of the month.

There is no server-side component. It all runs in your browser.

A version is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://penguinofthunder.github.io/projects/stepscalc/stepscalc.html).
