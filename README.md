# Steps Calculator

Set a goal for the month and use this at any time to calculate how many steps you need to take each day to reach your goal by the end of the month.

There is no server-side component. It all runs in your browser.

A version is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://penguinofthunder.github.io/stepscalc/).

## Localization

The calculator is localized with i18next.

The English and Norwegian translations were hand-translated by the author, however the Spanish was translated by Copilot.
